# Auto-Whatsapp-Messenger
This code can help you to send automatic messages in Whatsapp.

Provide a .csv or .xls* file containing phone numbers in a column to send an
equal message to all of them.

Make sure that the area/state code is informed in your
numbers, otherwise the message will not be delivered.

Note: The code takes some time to send the message because of the
pywhatkit external library delay. If you are going to send a lot of
messages, it will be better to 'leave' the code running because it
will take some time.
